* Matplotlib:- 

-> Matplotlib was developed by Michael Droettboom in 2003.
-> It is a plotting library for the python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
-> It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits.
-> It is used to draw different types of graphs on a given data.


* matplotlib.pyplot -> It is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. 
			  -> Each pyplot function makes some changes to a figure.


* rcParams -> It stands for "run command/runtime configuration" Parameters.
	     -> It is used for customizing matplotlib.


* figure.figsize -> This attribute allows us to specify the width & height of a figure in unit inches.


* subplots() -> This method provides a way to plot multiple plots on a single figure.
		 -> Given the number of rows & columns, it returns a tuple (fig, ax), giving a single figure fig with an array of axes ax.


* pyplot -> pyplot is a package methods to plot graphs in matplotlib.


* linestyle :- 
	
		Character			Description

		  '-'				solid line style
		  '--'			dashed line style		
		  '-.'			dash-dot line style
		  ':'				dotted line style


* Format Strings :-

	'b'   -> Blue markers with default shape.
	'or'  -> Red circles.
	'-g'  -> Green solid line.
	'--'  -> Dashed line with default color.
	'^k:' -> Black triangle_up markers connected by dotted line.


* Markers :-
	
		Character			Description

		  '.'				Point marker
		  ','				Pixel marker
		  'o'				Circle marker
		  'v'				Triangle_down marker
		  '^'				Triangle_up marker
		  '<'				Triangle_left marker		  
		  '>'				Triangle_right marker
		  '1'				Tri_down marker
		  '2'				Tri_up marker
		  '3'				Tri_left marker
		  '4'				Tri_right marker
		  's'				Square marker
		  'p'				Pentagon marker

		  '+'				Plus marker
		  'x'				x marker
		  'D'				Diamond marker
		  'd'				Thin_diamond marker
		  '|'				Vline marker
		  '_'				Hline marker


* Colors :-

		Character			Description

		  'b'				Blue
		  'g'				Green
		  'r'				Red
		  'c'				Cyan
		  'm'				Magenta
		  'y'				Yellow
		  'k'				Black
		  'w'				White

	-> and, the 'CN' colors that index into the default property cycle.
	-> If the color is the only part of the format string, you can additionally use any matplotlib strings ("#008000")


* Histogram :-

-> Histogram is like a bar graph, but here, it can generate bar graphs on a single data list.
-> It is a graph to show frequency distribution.
-> It takes single data list and put them on X axis and show frequency on Y axis from same data using bars.
-> It can be used when you have numerical data only.
