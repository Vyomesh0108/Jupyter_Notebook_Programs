* Scikit-leran :-

-> It is one of the most useful machine learning library.
-> It is created in python.
-> Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy is mainly used to create Scikit-learn.
-> It was developed in August 2013.
-> It is mainly used for modeling the data.
-> A collection of data is called Dataset.
-> It is having following two components :-
	1) Features.
	2) Response.

	1) Features :
		-> The variable of the data are called features.
		-> They are also called predictors, inputs and attributes.

			* Feature metrics :- It is the collection of features, in case there are more than one.

			* Feature names :- It is the list of all the names of the features.

	2) Response :
		-> It is the output variable that basically depends upon the features variables.
		-> They are also known as Target, label or output.

			* Response vector :- It is used to represent response column.
							   :- Generally, we have just one response column.

			* Target names :- It represent the possible values taken by a response vector.

-> Scikit-learn library includes datasets like iris and digits for classification and the Boston house prices for regression.

-> To perform process in Scikit-learn following 3 steps must be executed :-
	1) Load the data set.
	2) Split the data set.
	3) Train the model.
