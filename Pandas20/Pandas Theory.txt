* Pandas (Panel data) :- 

-> Pandas is a high level data manipulation tool developed by wes mckinney.
-> It is build on numpy packages.
-> Key data structure for it is called DataFrame.
-> It allows you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variable.
-> Pandas is an open source python library, providing high performance data manipulation and analysis tools using its powerful data structures.


* Key features of pandas :-

1) Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.
2) Tools for loading data into in memory data objects from different file formats. 
3) Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
4) Reshaping and pivoting of datasets.
5) High performance merging and joining of data.
6) Time series functionality.

-> DataFrame => Table (2-dimensional array)
-> Series => Column (1-dimensional array)
-> Panel => 3-dimensional array


* Only for knowledge and understanding purpose :- 

-> Basically, NumPy is used to perform numeric or mathematical operations on huge amount of numbers only.
-> While, Pandas is used to convert anytype of data, whether it may be in dictionary, JSON or file into table, column, row format.
-> Here in pandas table is called DataFrame and column is called series.


* XML :-

-> XML stands for Extensible markup language.
-> XML file is a collection of tags.
-> First tag in XML is called root tag.
-> XML is the most light-weight file.


* Map and Replace :-

-> Map and replace both function are used to replace specific data values in DataFrame with new values, but map displays only changes and matching value and print NaN for non-matching other value.
-> Replace functions shows all matching and non-matching values.
